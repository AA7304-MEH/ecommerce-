# Security Configuration Guide

## 🔐 Environment Variables Protection

Your API credentials are securely stored in `.env.local` and protected by:

### ✅ Security Measures in Place:

1. **`.gitignore` Protection**: 
   - `.env*.local` files are automatically excluded from git commits
   - Additional protection for secrets/ directory and key files

2. **Local-Only Storage**:
   - Credentials stored in `.env.local` (never committed to version control)
   - Only accessible on your local development machine

3. **Next.js Security**:
   - Environment variables only available on server-side
   - Client-side code cannot access sensitive credentials
   - Automatic prefix filtering (NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client access only)

### 🚨 Important Security Notes:

- **Never commit** `.env.local` to git
- **Never share** your API secrets in public channels
- **Never expose** credentials in client-side code
- **Always use** environment variables for sensitive data
- **Rotate keys** regularly for enhanced security

### 📁 Current Configuration:

```
├── .env.local          ← Your secrets (protected by .gitignore)
├── .gitignore          ← Security configuration
└── SECURITY.md         ← This security guide
```

### 🔄 For Production Deployment:

When deploying to production (Netlify, Vercel, etc.):

1. **Add environment variables** in your hosting platform's dashboard
2. **Never include** production secrets in code
3. **Use secure variable storage** provided by your hosting service
4. **Rotate keys** regularly for enhanced security

### 🛡️ API Key Security Features:

**AliExpress API:**
- **App Key**: `519544` (can be public, identifies your application)
- **App Secret**: `xw2f8A...` (private, used for request signing)
- **Signature Generation**: All requests are cryptographically signed
- **Request Validation**: AliExpress validates each request signature

**Razorpay Payment Gateway:**
- **Live Key ID**: `rzp_live_R7d...` (public, for frontend integration)
- **Key Secret**: `***` (private, server-side only for verification)
- **Live Environment**: Production-ready for real transactions
- **Webhook Security**: Signature verification for payment events
- **PCI DSS Compliance**: Bank-level security standards

### ✅ What's Protected:

Your sensitive credentials are now secure and will not be exposed in:
- Git repositories
- Public code sharing
- Client-side JavaScript
- Browser developer tools
- Production deployments (when configured properly)

**Remember**: Your App Secret is like a password - keep it private and secure! 🔒
